This code is a Python program that uses the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) to select an audio file in WAV format and apply noise reduction using the noisereduce library. Here is a detailed description of each part of the code:

Importing Libraries:

tkinter and filedialog are imported to create the graphical interface and allow file selection.
wavfile is imported from the scipy.io library to read and write audio files in WAV format.
noisereduce is imported to apply noise reduction to the audio.
select_file function:

This function opens a dialog window for the user to select a WAV file.
If a file is selected, the file path is entered into the entry field.
reduce_noise function:

This function gets the file path entered in the input field.
If a file path is valid, the audio file is read.
Noise reduction is applied to audio using the noisereduce library's reduce_noise function.
The processed audio is saved in a new file called mywav_reduced_noise.wav.
A status message is displayed indicating that noise reduction is complete and the output file is saved.
Creating the Main Window and UI Elements:

The main (root) window is created and its title is set to "Noise Reduction".
Labels, input fields, buttons and a status label are created and positioned in the window using the grid method.
The "Browse" button calls the select_file function when clicked.
The "Reduce Noise" button calls the reduce_noise function when clicked.
The status label is used to display messages to the user.
Main Loop:

root.mainloop() starts the application's main loop, allowing the graphical interface to respond to user interactions.
